# Triangle ADT in C

This project implements an **ADT (Abstract Data Type) in C to manipulate triangles**.  
It includes the files **triangle.h** (header) and **triangle.c** (implementation), as well as a **test.c** file used to validate the functions.

## Features
- Define the sides of a triangle
- Identify its type (equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid)
- Display the sides in a formatted way
- Calculate the perimeter
- Calculate the area using Heronâ€™s formula
- Check whether two triangles are similar based on the proportion of their sides
